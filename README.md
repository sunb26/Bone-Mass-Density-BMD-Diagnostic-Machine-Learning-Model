# Bone-Mass-Density-BMD-Diagnostic-Machine-Learning-Model
At least 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men will suffer a bone fracture from osteoporosis in their lifetime. Osteoporosis is a disease where an individual's bone density is severely lower than that of a healthy individual. This leads to greater risk of fracture and can cause death. As a result, it is imparative to diagnose low bone density and osteoporosis early on. With this research project, I explored the possibilities of using artificial intelligence as a way to more accurately (and more cost efficiently) diagnose a patient who may have low bone density or even osteoporosis. I tried four different models in total, Logistic regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, XGboost. This was my first step into the world of AI and I am eager to learn more from others!
